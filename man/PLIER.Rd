\usage{
PLIER(data, priorMat, svdres = NULL, k = NULL, L1 = NULL, L2 = NULL,
  L3 = NULL, frac = 0.7, max.iter = 350, trace = F, scale = T,
  Chat = NULL, maxPath = 10, doCrossval = T, penalty.factor = rep(1,
  ncol(priorMat)), glm_alpha = 0.9, minGenes = 10, tol = 1e-06,
  seed = 123456, allGenes = F, rseed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{the data to be processed with genes in rows and samples in columns. Should be z-scored or set scale=T}

\item{priorMat}{the binary prior information matrix with genes in rows and pathways/genesets in columns}

\item{svdres}{Pre-computed result of the svd decomposition for data}

\item{k}{The number of latent variables to return, leave as NULL to be set automatically using the num.pc "elbow" method}

\item{L1}{L1 constant, leave as NULL to automatically select a value}

\item{L2}{L2 constant, leave as NULL to automatically select a value}

\item{L3}{L3 constant, leave as NULL to automatically select a value. Sparsity in U should be instead controlled by setting frac}

\item{frac}{The fraction of LVs that should have at least 1 prior inforamtion association, used to automatically set L3}

\item{max.iter}{Maximum number of iterations to perform}

\item{trace}{Display progress information}

\item{scale}{Z-score the data before processing}

\item{Chat}{A ridge inverse of priorMat, used to select active pathways, expensive to compute so can be precomputed when running PLIER multiple times}

\item{maxPath}{The maximum number of active pathways per latent variable}

\item{doCrossval}{Whether or not to do real cross-validation with held-out pathway genes. Alternatively, all gene annotations are used and only pseudo-crossvalidation is done. The latter option may be preferable if some pathways of interest have few genes.}

\item{penalty.factor}{A vector equal to the number of columns in priorMat. Sets relative penalties for different pathway/geneset subsets. Lower penalties will make a pathway more likely to be used. Only the relative values matter. Internally rescaled.}

\item{glm_alpha}{Set the alpha for elastic-net}

\item{minGenes}{The minimum number of genes a pathway must have to be considered}

\item{tol}{Convergence threshold}

\item{seed}{Set the seed for pathway cross-validation}

\item{allGenes}{Use all genes. By default only genes in the priorMat matrix are used.}

\item{rseed}{Set this option to use a random initialization, instead of SVD}
